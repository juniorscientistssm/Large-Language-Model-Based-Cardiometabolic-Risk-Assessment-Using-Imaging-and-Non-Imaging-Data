# Large-Language-Model-Based-Cardiometabolic-Risk-Assessment-Using-Imaging-and-Non-Imaging-Data
The "Cardiometabolic Risk Assessment Using Imaging and Non-Imaging Data" repository on GitHub serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of medical imaging and cardiovascular health. This repository hosts a sophisticated large language model (LLM)-based solution tailored specifically for assessing cardiometabolic risk using a combination of imaging and non-imaging data.

The repository contains code, models, and documentation necessary to replicate and extend the cardiometabolic risk assessment framework presented in the associated research papers. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including deep learning and natural language processing, the solution integrates diverse datasets, including medical images (such as MRI or CT scans) and non-imaging data (such as electronic health records and genetic information).

Key features of the repository include:

Pre-trained Models: Pre-trained large language models optimized for cardiometabolic risk assessment, capable of processing both imaging and non-imaging data modalities.
Data Processing Pipelines: Scalable data processing pipelines for preprocessing, feature extraction, and data augmentation of imaging and non-imaging datasets.
Model Training and Evaluation: Scripts and utilities for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating machine learning models on diverse datasets for cardiometabolic risk prediction.
Visualization Tools: Visualization tools and utilities for exploring and interpreting model predictions, including interactive dashboards and visual analytics.
Documentation and Examples: Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and example notebooks guiding users through the installation, setup, and usage of the framework for their own research and applications.
Community Support: Active community support through discussions, issue tracking, and contributions from researchers, developers, and healthcare professionals interested in advancing cardiometabolic risk assessment using imaging and non-imaging data.
With a focus on reproducibility, scalability, and interpretability, this repository empowers researchers and practitioners to develop and deploy robust cardiometabolic risk assessment solutions, facilitating early detection, intervention, and personalized management of cardiovascular diseases.
